#
# Every path the backend derives lives here (tech-debt audit BE-13, #27).
# Previously `Path(__file__).parent.parent / "<dir>"` was repeated across eight
# modules and the literal "sessions" appeared in four of them independently, so
# a layout rename meant finding each one by hand.
#
# `.parent.parent` is purely lexical and every consumer lives in `backend/`, so
# this is byte-identical to what each module computed for itself — deliberately
# *not* `.resolve()`d. `user_data_dir=` receives `str(path)`, and a different
# string is a different Chrome profile.
#
# Consumers re-export these under their existing module-level names rather than
# referencing `config.X` at the call site. That is not stylistic: conftest
# redirects several of them away from the maintainer's real files with autouse
# fixtures (`monkeypatch.setattr(instagram_browser, "SESSIONS_DIR", ...)`), and
# a call-site reference would step around the redirect and let the suite run
# against live session data. `tests/test_paths.py` pins all fourteen values.

# PREFLIGHT_CHECK_PLATFORMS=none turned seven tests red without a line of code
# changing, and a fresh clone (no credentials.env at all) exercised a third
# set of values again. A gate whose result depends on a gitignored file is not
# a gate. Tests get the shipped defaults; a test that wants another value
# monkeypatches the constant in the module that consumes it.
